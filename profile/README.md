## logion - The Blockchain Infrastructure of Safe Digital Ownership

logion is a blockchain-based distributed infrastructure operated by a community of Logion Legal Officers (LLO). logion provides the following features:

- Wallet protection through social recovery and multi-signature
- Digital asset protection through the Legal Officer Case (LOC) and restricted delivery of digital assets to the NFT owner

logion aims to become a [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) Parachain, but is already live as a standalone blockchain:

- [Standalone mainnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc01.logion.network#/explorer)
- [Standalone testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://test-rpc01.logion.network#/explorer)

### Want to discover logion?
